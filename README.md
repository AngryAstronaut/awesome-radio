# Awesome Radio

A curated list of awesome radio resources. Inspired by awesome-*.

I recently pulled out my CB radio and installed it in my truck. This inspired me
to create an open source repository of all the radio related resources I found
helpful and my notes on the subject.

This project is aimed at hackers who enjoy all aspects of radio communication.
While a lot of this technology isn't usable by citizens and is heavily regulated
by the FCC, just knowing anything about it is special. I've been interested in
learning the ins and outs of radio, as well as hearing stories, new and old.

## CB

Citizens band radio, or CB, is a two way radio spectrum dedicated to open use by
anyone for almost any purpose. It (at least in the US and many other countries)
does not require a license to operate. CB consists of 40 channels between 26.965
MHz and 27.405 MHz with channel 09 being dedicated to emergencies.

CB is more popular among truckers and radio enthusiasts, but it's usefulness
does not stop there. It's great for long distance travel on popular trucking
routes. You can tune to channel 19 (an unofficial trucker's channel) and get
real time traffic updates, alternate routes and accident warnings.

Given a good antenna that's properly tuned, a typical range to expect out of
your CB is about 2 - 5 miles (3.2 - 8 kilometers).

### General Use

I've found a lot of my information on Jeep and trucker forums. From my own
experience, it seems about half the CB transmission I hear include a handle of
some kind. I also hear a lot of swearing, so I wouldn't sweat accidentally
letting a "fuck" or a "shit" go.

CB is public. Very public. That seems like a "no shit" kind of thing, but with
the current generation pretty much only using cell phones, it's easy to forget
that using something as "primitive" as a CB radio is essentially [roadcast to
the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio#Working_skip).

Truckers tend to use channel 19. This is a good channel to monitor for traffic
conditions.

Channel 09 is for emergencies only. No general chatter on this channel. If you
are broke down, or your car catches fire, besides calling 911, this is a good
channel to transmit on for help.

Around Portland, I hear a lot of chatter on channels 06, 17 and 28. These are
good channels for entertaining conversation.

### SWR

[SWR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio), or Standing Wave Ratio is a measurement of efficiency when connecting your
antenna to your radio.

Optimum ration 1:1. Although you'll probably end up with 1.3 or so. Anything
higher than 2 should be considered a no-no since it can damage your radio and
give poor transmission. Read up on [how to tune
SWR](http://www.rightchannelradios.com/tuning-cb-antenna-adjusting-swr).

### Installing a mobile CB

Installing your CB right is key to A) not damaging your radio hardware and B)
getting good range and quality on both the receiving and transmitting ends.

Following the advice in the following articles will ensure you have a quality
setup.

## Amateur Radio (a.k.a Ham Radio)

The hobby of Amateur Radio has a long and proud tradition. The very first radio amateurs were true pioneers of radio technology. Amateurs 'invented' and refined much of the early radio technology and were the first to transmit music, radio plays, and information to the handful of people who had the new fangled radio receivers.

After World War II the hobby of amateur radio flourished. Radio clubs sprang up in schools all over the world and kids went home each night to build some new contraption, or have a chat with someone over the wireless. These young people became the mainstay of the technical professions and developed much of the modern technology we use today. ([WIA](http://www.wia.org.au/licenses/foundation/about/))

### Amature Radio License

* In the [US](http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed) there are three license classesâ€”Technician, General and Extra.
* [The Foundation Licence](http://www.wia.org.au/licenses/foundation/about/) in Australia.
* [Foundation Licence] (http://rsgb.org/main/clubs-training/for-students/foundation/) in the UK.
* In [Pakistan](http://www.pakhams.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75&Itemid=92) first you apply for SWL (Short Wave Listener) membership and then you are eligible to [apply for the HAM License](http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=466%3Aamateur-wireless-license&catid=138%3Aguidelines&Itemid=349).
