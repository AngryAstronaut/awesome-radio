# Awesome Radio (No, not the music kind)

A curated list of awesome radio resources.

I recently pulled out my CB radio and installed it in my truck. This inspired me
to create an open source repository of all the radio related resources I found
helpful and my notes on the subject.

[Right Channel Radios](http://www.rightchannelradios.com/) - Good online shop
for parts, radios, antennas and mounts.

### General Use

I've found a lot of my information on Jeep and trucker forums. From my own
experience, it seems about half the CB transmission I hear include a handle of
some kind. I also hear a lot of swearing, so I wouldn't sweat accidentally
letting a "fuck" or a "shit" go.

CB is public. Very public. That seems like a "no shit" kind of thing, but with
the current generation pretty much only using cell phones, it's easy to forget
that using something as "primitive" as a CB radio is essentially [roadcast to
the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio#Working_skip).

Truckers tend to use channel 19. This is a good channel to monitor for traffic
conditions.

Channel 09 is for emergencies only. No general chatter on this channel. If you
are broke down, or your car catches fire, besides calling 911, this is a good
channel to transmit on for help.

Around Portland, I hear a lot of chatter on channels 06, 17 and 28. These are
good channels for entertaining conversation.

### SWR

SWR, or Standing Wave Ration is a measurement of efficiency when connecting your
antenna to your radio.

Optimum ration 1:1. Although you'll probably end up with 1.3 or so. Anything
higher than 2 should be considered a no-no since it can damage your radio and
give poor transmission.

## GNU Radio

TODO: This is for when I get around to checking out GNU Radio projects.
